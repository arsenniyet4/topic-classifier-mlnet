Machine learning application for article topic classification using ML.NET

# Topic Classifier

A machine learning application that classifies articles into topics using supervised learning techniques.

## Tech Stack
- C#
- .NET Core
- ML.NET
- Python
- Visual Studio

## Project Overview
This project implements a topic classification system that analyzes article text and predicts its category. The application follows a multi-tiered architecture for modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## Features
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Supervised machine learning model training
- Article topic prediction
- Modular multi-tier design

## Architecture
- Presentation layer handles input/output
- Business logic layer manages classification flow
- Model layer performs ML inference

## What I Learned
- Applying machine learning to real-world text data
- Using ML.NET for model training and inference
- Designing scalable multi-tier applications
- Model evaluation and accuracy trade-offs
